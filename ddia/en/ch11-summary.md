# Chapter 11 Summary: Batch Processing

## Core Theme
Understanding batch processing systems, from Unix tools to MapReduce and modern dataflow engines, for processing large datasets efficiently and reliably.

## Three Types of Systems

### Services (Online Systems)
- **Request/Response Pattern**: Wait for client requests, respond quickly
- **Performance Metric**: Response time and availability
- **User Interaction**: Human users waiting for responses
- **Examples**: Web servers, databases, APIs

### Batch Processing (Offline Systems)
- **Job-Based Processing**: Process large input datasets to produce output
- **Performance Metric**: Throughput (time to process dataset)
- **Execution Pattern**: Scheduled periodically, no waiting users
- **Duration**: Minutes to days
- **Key Property**: Bounded input data

### Stream Processing (Near-Real-Time)
- **Continuous Processing**: Process events shortly after they occur
- **Input Pattern**: Unbounded streams of data
- **Latency**: Lower than batch, higher than online
- **Key Property**: Never-ending input streams

## Unix Philosophy and Batch Processing

### Unix Design Principles
- **Immutable Inputs**: Don't modify input data
- **Composable Tools**: Small programs that "do one thing well"
- **Uniform Interface**: Files and pipes connect programs
- **Unknown Future**: Output becomes input to other programs

### Unix Tools for Data Processing
- **Text Processing**: awk, grep, sed, sort, uniq
- **Pipes**: Connect output of one program to input of another
- **Sorting**: External sort algorithms for large datasets
- **Advantages**: Simple, fast, well-tested, composable

### Limitations of Unix Tools
- **Single Machine**: Can't scale beyond one machine
- **No Fault Tolerance**: Process failure loses all work
- **Limited Parallelism**: Mostly single-threaded processing

## MapReduce and Distributed Batch Processing

### MapReduce Overview
- **Historical Context**: Based on 1940s-1950s card-sorting machines
- **Google's Algorithm**: Published 2004, "makes Google massively scalable"
- **Key Innovation**: Distributed processing on commodity hardware
- **Programming Model**: Map and Reduce functions

### MapReduce Execution Model

**Map Phase**:
- Extract key-value pairs from input records
- Partition output by key
- Sort and group by key

**Reduce Phase**:
- Process all values for each key
- Produce final output
- Write results to distributed filesystem

### Distributed Filesystem (HDFS)
- **Uniform Interface**: Replaces Unix pipes in distributed setting
- **Fault Tolerance**: Replication across multiple machines
- **Large Files**: Optimized for sequential access
- **Block Storage**: Files split into blocks, distributed across nodes

## Core Problems in Distributed Batch Processing

### Partitioning
**Purpose**: Bring related data together
- **Input Partitioning**: Based on file blocks
- **Output Partitioning**: Configurable number of reducer partitions
- **Key Grouping**: All records with same key go to same reducer
- **Sorting and Merging**: Organize data for efficient processing

### Fault Tolerance
**MapReduce Approach**:
- **Frequent Disk Writes**: Easy recovery but slower execution
- **Task-Level Recovery**: Restart individual failed tasks
- **Deterministic Operations**: Same input produces same output

**Modern Dataflow Engines**:
- **Memory-Based**: Keep more data in memory
- **Selective Materialization**: Write to disk only when necessary
- **Recomputation**: Rebuild lost data from inputs

## Join Algorithms in Batch Processing

### Sort-Merge Joins
**Process**:
1. Extract join keys in mappers
2. Partition, sort, and merge by key
3. Co-locate records with same key
4. Join in reducer function

**Use Case**: Both inputs are large

### Broadcast Hash Joins
**Process**:
1. Load small dataset into hash table
2. Broadcast to all mappers
3. Stream large dataset through mappers
4. Lookup each record in hash table

**Use Case**: One input is small enough to fit in memory

### Partitioned Hash Joins
**Requirements**: Both inputs partitioned identically
- Same key, hash function, and partition count
- Build hash table per partition
- Process partitions independently

**Use Case**: Both inputs are large but pre-partitioned

## Beyond MapReduce: Modern Dataflow Engines

### Limitations of MapReduce
- **Disk I/O Overhead**: Writes intermediate results to disk
- **Two-Stage Limitation**: Only map and reduce phases
- **Complex Workflows**: Require chaining multiple jobs

### Dataflow Engines
**Examples**: Spark, Tez, Flink
**Improvements**:
- **Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)**: More flexible execution plans
- **In-Memory Processing**: Avoid unnecessary disk writes
- **Operator Fusion**: Combine multiple operations
- **Iterative Algorithms**: Support for machine learning workloads

### Apache Spark
- **Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs)**: Fault-tolerant data structures
- **Lazy Evaluation**: Build execution plan before running
- **Caching**: Keep frequently accessed data in memory
- **Rich APIs**: Support for SQL, streaming, machine learning

## High-Level APIs and Query Optimization

### SQL-on-Hadoop
**Tools**: Hive, Spark SQL, Impala
**Benefits**:
- **Familiar Interface**: SQL for data analysts
- **Query Optimization**: Cost-based optimizers
- **Schema Evolution**: Handle changing data structures

### Dataflow APIs
**Examples**: Pig, Cascading, Crunch, FlumeJava
**Features**:
- **Higher-Level Abstractions**: Hide MapReduce complexity
- **Automatic Optimization**: Generate efficient execution plans
- **Type Safety**: Compile-time error checking

## Graph Processing

### Bulk Synchronous Parallel (BSP) Model
- **Supersteps**: Computation divided into phases
- **Message Passing**: Vertices communicate between supersteps
- **Synchronization**: Global barrier between phases

### Pregel Model
**Examples**: Giraph, GraphX
**Algorithm Structure**:
1. Process messages from previous superstep
2. Update vertex state
3. Send messages to neighbors
4. Vote to halt or continue

**Use Cases**: PageRank, shortest paths, community detection

## Batch Processing Patterns

### Lambda Architecture
**Components**:
- **Batch Layer**: Precompute views from historical data
- **Speed Layer**: Handle recent data with low latency
- **Serving Layer**: Merge batch and real-time views

**Trade-offs**: Complexity vs completeness and latency

### Output Databases
**Specialized Systems**:
- **Key-Value Stores**: Voldemort, ElephantDB for serving batch results
- **Search Indexes**: Elasticsearch, Solr for full-text search
- **OLAP Cubes**: Pre-aggregated data for analytics

## Fault Tolerance and Reliability

### Deterministic Operations
- **Pure Functions**: No side effects, same input → same output
- **Retry Safety**: Failed tasks can be restarted safely
- **Exactly-Once Semantics**: Framework ensures correct output

### Task Isolation
- **Stateless Functions**: Mappers and reducers don't share state
- **Output Atomicity**: Only successful tasks make output visible
- **Framework Responsibility**: Handle distributed systems complexity

### Advantages Over Online Systems
- **Stronger Guarantees**: Batch jobs provide exactly-once processing
- **Simpler Programming Model**: No need to handle partial failures
- **Automatic Recovery**: Framework handles fault tolerance

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Techniques
- **Data Locality**: Process data where it's stored
- **Compression**: Reduce I/O and network overhead
- **Columnar Storage**: Efficient for analytical workloads
- **Predicate Pushdown**: Filter data early in pipeline

### Skew Handling
- **Hot Keys**: Some keys have much more data
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute work evenly across nodes
- **Sampling**: Estimate data distribution
- **Repartitioning**: Split large partitions

## Key Insights

### Design Principles
- **Immutability**: Don't modify input data
- **Composability**: Build complex systems from simple components
- **Fault Tolerance**: Assume failures will happen
- **Determinism**: Reproducible results from same inputs

### Trade-offs
- **Latency vs Throughput**: Batch optimizes for throughput
- **Complexity vs Performance**: Higher-level APIs vs hand-tuned code

### Evolution of Batch Processing
