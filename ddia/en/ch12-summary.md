# Chapter 12 Summary: Stream Processing

## Core Theme
Understanding stream processing systems that handle unbounded, continuously arriving data streams, bridging the gap between batch processing and real-time systems.

## Stream Processing vs Batch Processing

### Key Differences
**Batch Processing**:
- **Bounded Input**: Known, finite dataset size
- **Complete Processing**: Must read entire input before producing output
- **Periodic Execution**: Runs at scheduled intervals (daily, hourly)
- **High Latency**: Changes reflected hours or days later

**Stream Processing**:
- **Unbounded Input**: Continuous, never-ending data streams
- **Incremental Processing**: Process events as they arrive
- **Continuous Execution**: Always running, processing events immediately
- **Low Latency**: Changes reflected within seconds or milliseconds

### The Motivation
- **Real-time Requirements**: Users want immediate responses to events
- **Continuous Data**: Data arrives gradually over time, never "complete"
- **Reduced Delay**: Process events as they happen rather than in batches
- **Always-On Systems**: Business processes that never stop

## Message Brokers and Event Logs

### AMQP/JMS-Style Message Brokers

**Characteristics**:
- **Individual Message Assignment**: Broker assigns messages to specific consumers
- **Acknowledgment-Based**: Consumers acknowledge successful processing
- **Message Deletion**: Messages deleted after acknowledgment
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute work across multiple consumers

**Use Cases**:
- **Task Queues**: Asynchronous job processing
- **RPC Systems**: Request-response patterns
- **Work Distribution**: When message order doesn't matter

**Examples**: RabbitMQ, ActiveMQ, Amazon SQS

### Log-Based Message Brokers

**Characteristics**:
- **Partition Assignment**: All messages in partition go to same consumer
- **Ordered Delivery**: Messages always delivered in same order
- **Offset Tracking**: Consumers track progress via checkpoints
- **Message Retention**: Messages kept on disk for replay

**Use Cases**:
- **Stream Processing**: When order and replay matter
- **Event Sourcing**: Maintaining complete event history
- **Data Integration**: Synchronizing multiple systems

**Examples**: Apache Kafka, Amazon Kinesis, Apache Pulsar

### Comparison
| Feature | AMQP/JMS | Log-Based |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| Message Assignment | Individual | Partition-based |
| Ordering | No guarantee | Strict within partition |
| Replay | Not possible | Full replay capability |
| Parallelism | Consumer-level | Partition-level |
| State Management | Stateless | Offset-based state |

## Sources of Event Streams

### User Activity Events
- **Web Analytics**: Page views, clicks, searches
- **Mobile Apps**: Screen views, button taps, gestures
- **IoT Sensors**: Temperature, location, motion data
- **Financial Trading**: Market data, order events

### Database Changes as Streams

**Change Data Capture (CDC)**:
- **Database Logs**: Capture transaction log changes
- **Triggers**: Database triggers generate events
- **Polling**: Periodically check for changes
- **Tools**: Debezium, Maxwell, Bottled Water

**Event Sourcing**:
- **Explicit Events**: Application generates events directly
- **Immutable Log**: Events never modified, only appended
- **State Reconstruction**: Current state derived from event history
- **Complete Audit Trail**: Full history of all changes

### Log Compaction
- **Key-Based Retention**: Keep latest value for each key
- **Space Efficiency**: Remove obsolete events
- **State Snapshots**: Maintain current database state
- **Bootstrapping**: New consumers get current state quickly

## Stream Processing Use Cases

### Complex Event Processing (CEP)
- **Pattern Detection**: Find sequences of related events
- **Rule Engines**: Apply business rules to event streams
- **Fraud Detection**: Identify suspicious patterns
- **Monitoring**: Alert on system anomalies

### Stream Analytics
- **Windowed Aggregations**: Count, sum, average over time windows
- **Real-time Dashboards**: Live metrics and KPIs
- **Trending Analysis**: Detect popular topics or items
- **Performance Monitoring**: System and application metrics

### Materialized Views
- **Derived Data**: Keep search indexes, caches up-to-date
- **Data Integration**: Synchronize multiple data systems
- **CQRS**: Separate read and write models
- **Real-time Recommendations**: Update user profiles continuously

## Time in Stream Processing

### Types of Time
**Processing Time**:
- When event is processed by stream processor
- Easy to implement but not meaningful for business logic
- Affected by system delays and failures

**Event Time**:
- When event actually occurred in real world
- More meaningful but harder to implement
- Requires handling out-of-order events

### Windowing
**Tumbling Windows**:
- Fixed-size, non-overlapping time intervals
- Each event belongs to exactly one window
- Example: Count events per hour

**Hopping Windows**:
- Fixed-size, overlapping time intervals
- Events can belong to multiple windows
- Example: 5-minute windows every minute

**Session Windows**:
- Variable-size windows based on activity
- Window closes after period of inactivity
- Example: User session analysis

### Handling Late Events
- **Watermarks**: Estimate when all events for window have arrived
- **Grace Periods**: Allow late events within reasonable time
- **Corrections**: Update results when late events arrive
- **Trade-offs**: Completeness vs latency

## Stream Joins

### Stream-Stream Joins
**Purpose**: Join events from two streams within time window
**Example**: Match user clicks with ad impressions
**Implementation**:
- Buffer events from both streams
- Join events within time window
- Handle event ordering and late arrivals

### Stream-Table Joins
**Purpose**: Enrich stream events with reference data
**Example**: Add user profile data to activity events
**Implementation**:
- Maintain local copy of table via changelog
- Join each stream event with current table state
- Handle table updates and stream events

### Table-Table Joins
**Purpose**: Join two changing datasets
**Example**: Join user profiles with account information
**Implementation**:
- Both inputs are database changelogs
- Maintain materialized view of join result
- Update result when either table changes

## Fault Tolerance in Stream Processing

### Challenges
- **Long-Running Processes**: Can't restart from beginning
- **Continuous Output**: Can't discard all output on failure
- **State Management**: Must preserve processing state
- **Exactly-Once Semantics**: Avoid duplicate processing

### Approaches

**Microbatching**:
- Process small batches of events
- Checkpoint state between batches
- Restart from last checkpoint on failure
- Example: Spark Streaming

**Checkpointing**:
- Periodically save processor state
- Coordinate checkpoints across operators
- Restore state from checkpoint on failure
- Example: Apache Flink

**Transactions**:
- Use database transactions for state updates
- Ensure atomic state changes
- Handle failures through transaction rollback
- Example: Kafka Streams

**Idempotent Operations**:
- Design operations to be safely retryable
- Use unique identifiers to detect duplicates
- Combine with at-least-once delivery
- Achieve "effectively-once" semantics

### Exactly-Once vs At-Least-Once
**At-Least-Once**:
- Simpler to implement
- May process events multiple times
- Requires idempotent operations

**Exactly-Once**:
- More complex implementation
- Guarantees each event processed once
- Higher performance overhead
