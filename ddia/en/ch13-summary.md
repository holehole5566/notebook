# Chapter 13 Summary: Do the Right Thing

## Core Theme
Exploring how to design better data systems for the future, focusing on data integration, correctness, and ethical considerations in building data-intensive applications.

## The Future of Data Systems

### Moving Beyond Single Tools
**The Reality**:
- No single tool efficiently serves all use cases
- Applications must compose multiple software pieces
- Need for **data integration** across different systems
- Systems must work together harmoniously

**The Vision**:
- Applications that are more robust, correct, and evolvable
- Systems that are ultimately beneficial to humanity
- Better approaches than current state-of-the-art

## Data Integration Through Dataflow

### Systems of Record vs Derived Data
**Systems of Record**:
- Authoritative source of truth for specific data
- Primary storage for critical business data
- Source of changes that flow to other systems

**Derived Data**:
- Generated through transformations from systems of record
- Examples: indexes, materialized views, caches, ML models
- Can be recreated by rerunning transformations

### Dataflow Architecture
**Key Principles**:
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Transformations happen independently
- **Loose Coupling**: Problems in one area don't spread to others
- **Immutable Events**: Changes flow as immutable event streams
- **Reprocessability**: Can rerun transformations to fix issues

**Benefits**:
- **Fault Tolerance**: Isolated failures don't cascade
- **Evolvability**: Easy to change processing steps
- **Recovery**: Fix code and reprocess data
- **Robustness**: System remains stable under various conditions

## Unbundling the Database

### Traditional Database Components
- **Storage Engine**: How data is stored and retrieved
- **Query Engine**: How queries are processed
- **Transaction Manager**: Ensures ACID properties
- **Replication**: Keeps multiple copies synchronized
- **Indexing**: Accelerates data access

### Unbundled Approach
**Concept**: Break database into loosely coupled components
- **Separate Storage**: Different storage systems for different needs
- **Independent Processing**: Specialized engines for different workloads
- **Flexible Composition**: Mix and match components as needed

**Examples**:
- **Hadoop Ecosystem**: HDFS + various processing engines
- **Lambda Architecture**: Batch + stream processing layers
- **Microservices**: Each service owns its data

### Stream Processing as Database Inside-Out
- **Event Log**: Central nervous system of the application
- **Materialized Views**: Derived state updated from event streams
- **Query Processing**: Read from appropriate materialized views
- **State Management**: All state changes flow through event log

## End-to-End Data Flow

### From Database to User Interface
**Traditional Approach**:
- Database → Application → User Interface
- Polling for updates
- Manual refresh required

**Dataflow Approach**:
- Changes flow automatically to UI
- **Reactive User Interfaces**: Update automatically when data changes
- **Offline Capability**: Continue working without network
- **Real-time Updates**: See changes from other users immediately

### Technologies Enabling End-to-End Flow
- **WebSockets**: Real-time communication to browsers
- **Server-Sent Events**: Push updates to clients
- **Offline-First Applications**: Work without connectivity
- **Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs)**: Handle concurrent edits

## Correctness in Dataflow Systems

### Challenges with Distributed Correctness
- **Eventual Consistency**: Updates propagate asynchronously
- **Ordering Issues**: Events may arrive out of order
- **Partial Failures**: Some updates succeed, others fail
- **Concurrent Updates**: Multiple changes happening simultaneously

### Ensuring Correctness Without Distributed Transactions

**End-to-End Operation Identifiers**:
- **Idempotent Operations**: Safe to retry multiple times
- **Unique IDs**: Track operations across system boundaries
- **Deduplication**: Detect and ignore duplicate operations

**Asynchronous Constraint Checking**:
- **Eventual Validation**: Check constraints after the fact
- **Compensation**: Fix violations when detected
- **Apology-Based Systems**: Allow violations, apologize later

**Multi-Stage Processing**:
- **Tentative Operations**: Mark operations as pending
- **Validation Phase**: Check all constraints
- **Confirmation**: Make operations permanent after validation

### Advantages Over Traditional Approaches
- **Better Scalability**: No need for distributed locks
- **Geographic Distribution**: Works across regions
- **Fault Tolerance**: Continues working during failures
- **Performance**: Avoids coordination overhead

## Auditing and Data Integrity

### The Need for Auditing
- **Corruption Detection**: Find data corruption early
- **Compliance**: Meet regulatory requirements
- **Debugging**: Understand what went wrong
- **Trust**: Verify system behavior

### Audit Approaches
**Event Sourcing**:
- Keep complete history of all changes
- Immutable event log provides audit trail
- Can reconstruct any historical state

**Cryptographic Auditing**:
- **Hash Chains**: Link events cryptographically
- **Merkle Trees**: Efficient integrity verification
- **Digital Signatures**: Prove authenticity of events

**External Auditing**:
- **Independent Verification**: Third-party audit systems
- **Blockchain**: Distributed ledger for critical events
- **Certificate Transparency**: Public logs for verification

## Ethical Considerations

### The Power and Responsibility of Data
**Data Can Do Good**:
- **Medical Research**: Improve healthcare outcomes
- **Scientific Discovery**: Advance human knowledge
- **Efficiency**: Optimize resource usage
- **Personalization**: Better user experiences

**Data Can Cause Harm**:

- **Manipulation**: Influencing behavior without consent
- **Surveillance**: Monitoring and controlling populations

### Algorithmic Decision-Making Issues

**Bias and Discrimination**:
- **Training Data Bias**: Historical discrimination in data
- **Algorithmic Amplification**: Systems amplify existing biases
- **Feedback Loops**: Biased decisions create more biased data
- **Lack of Diversity**: Homogeneous teams miss important perspectives

**Lack of Transparency**:
- **Black Box Algorithms**: Decisions can't be explained
- **No Right to Explanation**: People affected can't understand why
- **Difficulty Appealing**: Hard to challenge algorithmic decisions
